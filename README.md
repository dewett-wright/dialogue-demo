# Godot 4 Simple NPC Dialogue System

This repository contains the completed code for my Godot 4 Simple Dialogue System tutorial. This system is designed to be simple to understand yet flexible enough to expand for your own game projects.

## Features

- Easy-to-implement NPC dialogue interaction
- Support for multiple dialogue lines per character
- Clean UI implementation with customizable styling

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open the project in Godot 4.x
3. Explore the demo scene to see the dialogue system in action
4. Check out the code to understand how it works

## How to Use in Your Own Project

### Basic Implementation

1. Copy the `DialogueUI` scene to your project
2. Add the `DialogueArea` component to your NPCs
3. Configure dialogue text in the Inspector
4. Connect your player to handle the interaction input

### Extending Functionality

The system is very minimal, but could be extended with:
- Dialogue branching
- Response choices
- Quest integration

## Project Structure

- `scenes/dialogue_box.tscn` - The main dialogue UI
- `scripts/dialogue_manager.gd` - Manages dialogue message display
- `scenes/dialogue_demo.tscn` - Example implementation
